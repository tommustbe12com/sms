# sms for GSM modems
An easy to use SMS application made in AutoIt to access GSM modem. Uses AT commands to send messages to any phone number of your choice, and sends over COM3 port.

## About
-# GSM modems are hard to use because there is a bunch of software that is not readily available for people to use for them. They either cost a lot of money or have malware. So, I created a simple low-storage solution that fixes these problems. Just make sure your GSM modem is plugged into COM3 and you're good to go!

## Notice
-# This script is still in progress and as of now DOES send the message, however there is no way to know it did. Also, it crashes when it is done sending (big flaw) so you will have to reopen the executable every time you want to use it again. I'm currently working on fixing that.

## Open source?
-# I plan on adding the au3 file soon, so you can suggest anything to fix the issues.
